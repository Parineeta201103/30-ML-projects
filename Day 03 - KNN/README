# 🔢 Day 03 - KNN: Digit Classification with scikit-learn

This project uses the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm to classify handwritten digits from the popular **Digits dataset** built into `scikit-learn`.

---

## 🗂 Dataset Info

- **Source**: `sklearn.datasets.load_digits()`
- 1,797 grayscale images
- Each image is 8×8 pixels (flattened to 64 features)
- 10 classes (digits 0 through 9)

---

## ⚙️ Model Info

- **Algorithm**: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **Library**: scikit-learn
- **Parameters**: `n_neighbors=3`
- **Train/Test Split**: 80/20

---

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

- **Accuracy**: e.g., 98%
- **Precision, Recall, F1-score** per class
- **Confusion Matrix**

---

## 📊 Visualizations

- ✅ Sample digit images with predictions
- ✅ Confusion matrix heatmap

---

## 🧠 Learnings

- Understood how KNN classifies based on proximity in feature space
- Saw how it performs really well on image classification with little tuning
- Learned about multiclass classification and evaluation
