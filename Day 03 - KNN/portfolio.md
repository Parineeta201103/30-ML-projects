# 🧠 Building a Data Science Portfolio for Jobs

A strong portfolio is your superpower as a data scientist. It helps you stand out by showcasing what you can **actually do**, not just what you say you know. Here's how to build a portfolio that impresses recruiters and hiring managers.

## 🧱 1. Structure Your GitHub Repository

Organize your GitHub to be your **central portfolio hub**.


Each folder should contain:
- 📜 A `README.md` with:
  - Problem statement
  - Dataset link
  - Methodology
  - Results/metrics
  - Visuals
  - What you learned

---

## 🌐 2. (Optional) Create a Portfolio Website

Having a website makes your portfolio shine even more.

### 🚀 Tools to use:
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) – host a site directly from your GitHub repo
- [Notion](https://notion.so) – clean, simple docs-style site
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) – build interactive dashboards & apps

## 💡 3. Must-Have Project Types

| Type                     | Example                                                   |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 📊 EDA + Visualization   | World Happiness, Netflix Trends                          |
| 🤖 ML Models             | House Price Prediction, Iris Classification              |
| 🧠 Deep Learning         | CNN for Image Classification, NLP with LSTMs             |
| 🔍 Real-World Case Study | Customer Segmentation, Churn Prediction                  |
| 📈 Time Series Forecast  | Sales forecasting, weather trends                        |
| 🎮 Fun/Creative          | Spotify playlist analysis, Pokémon stats predictions     |

## 🗣️ 4. Focus on Storytelling

> Go beyond the code. Talk about **why** you chose an algorithm, what insights you found, and how it performed.

For example:
> "I used Logistic Regression for the Iris dataset because it's interpretable and works well for small datasets. The model achieved 97% test accuracy."

## 📌 5. Pin Projects on GitHub

You can **pin 6 repositories** to the top of your profile:
- Go to your GitHub profile
- Click “Customize your pins”
- Select your most impressive projects
