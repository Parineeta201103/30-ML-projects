## 2. 🔍 Underexplored Diseases & Questionnaire Gaps

| Disease               | Validated Questionnaires       | Why Underexplored?                   | Research Opportunity                            |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **OCD**               | Y-BOCS, OCI-R                 | Focus on clinical diagnosis          | Ensemble models for severity prediction         |
| **Eating Disorders**  | EDE-Q, SCOFF                  | Bias toward behavioral studies       | ML for early detection via screening            |
| **Autism (Adults)**   | AQ, RAADS-14                  | Limited adult datasets               | Ensemble + NLP for self-reported symptoms       |
| **Borderline PD**     | MSI-BPD, PAI-BOR              | Complex symptom interplay            | Hybrid ensembles for comorbidity analysis       |
| **Insomnia**          | ISI, PSQI                     | Often secondary to other disorders   | Predict comorbidity with depression/anxiety     |
| **Hoarding Disorder** | SI-R                          | Niche focus, low prevalence studies  | Novel ensemble models for detection             |

## 3. 🚀 High-Potential Research Directions

### A. 🧩 Low-Hanging Fruit
- **OCD + Y-BOCS**: No ensemble-based research found. Use **XGBoost** to predict severity levels.
- **Insomnia + PSQI**: Only 1 paper applied RF. Try **stacked models** combining PSQI + PHQ-9 features.

### B. 💡 Innovative Combinations

| Disease Pair              | Questionnaires Used           | Suggested Ensemble Strategy                    |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| PTSD + Chronic Pain       | PCL-5 + Brief Pain Inventory  | Multimodal ensemble (clinical + sensor data)   |
| ADHD + Sleep Disorders    | ASRS + PSQI                   | Feature fusion + attention-based stacking      |

### C. 📋 Questionnaires Untapped for ML
- **LEAP (Loneliness in Elderly)** – No ML or ensemble research detected.
- **CD-RISC (Resilience Scale)** – Ideal for predictive modeling on coping mechanisms.
